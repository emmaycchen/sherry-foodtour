    question: "Do I have to pay for the food and drinks?",

    question: "Where does my tour start from?",
    answer:
      "To ensure that guests have the maximum time eating and exploring, we include an easy-to-find meeting point for each tour. The meeting point will be sent to you via email or text message along with the written Chinese to show a taxi driver if you need. If you have any concerns about finding the meeting point, feel free to get in touch. On the day you can also contact your guide via telephone, WhatsApp or email.",

    question: "After sending out the information, do I need to confirm?",

      "Your guide’s contact information will be sent to you, but otherwise no re-confirmation is necessary and all you need to do is be at the meeting point at the correct time to begin the tour.",

      <>
        Should you wish to change the date of your tour please email us at{" "}
        <Email /> and we will be happy to help make these changes for you,
        provided that we can fit you in. Date changes must be outside the
        cancellation period for your particular tour.

    question: "What happens if it’s raining?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Under most circumstances tours will continue to be run even if the
        weather isn’t quite as perfect as we’d all like it to be on holiday. Most
        tours feature indoor and undercover dining along the way and your guide
        may change the tour’s itinerary slightly to suit such occasions. Please
        bring an umbrella during rainy season. However, if tours are cancelled
        due to unforeseen circumstances, your guide will contact you. If you have
        any concerns about the weather, you can contact us at <Email />.
